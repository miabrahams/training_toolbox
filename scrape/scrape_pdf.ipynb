      "['Becoming the BBEG\\nWritten by Gorgonlurker', 'For many millenniums – it was well-known that black dragons held the secret to the necromantic arts. The \\nsecrets of death – and more. They were enigmatic figures, hardly known to the world… Often the cause of patronizing mortal demi-liches, or the ever-feared dracoliches that defined entire centuries… In recent eras, they had retreated away from the world – either out of a sense of responsibility, or simply to continue their morbid magics in humble hermitude.\\nAnd yet, despite the species’s notorious remoteness – our protagonist, a handsome black bat by the name of Guy, was more than enjoying having one in his company – an infamous black-dragon by the name of Rholyx, sucking him off in a desperate bid for survival.\\nWhy was it so desperate? One would think that a dragon would hardly be afraid of a single, lone adventurer-bat, but Guy was not your ordinary adventurer. His big, round balls, the size of soccer balls, was a testament to his extraordinary capabilities – and how outclassed the poor black dragon was.\\nSCHLUURHRRRP!\\nThe black dragon anthro’s snout had stretched out well, to accommodate Guy’s cock. Over 2’6 feet of raw cockflesh was pushed down the dragon’s throat, and poor Rholyx was struggling to take all of it - huffing  and puffing out air, as Guy continued to fuck his throat, with such prejudice that the dragon’s throat was simply forced to adapt to expanding out and taking that impressive girth.\\nSurely – if Rholyx did indeed survive, he’d have a promising future as a cumdump for any other horny, pent-up adventurer, but unfortunately, Guy was simply not the type to leave survivors. Though – he would never turn down a dragon eagerly embracing it’s inner-slut, and cut it all short. After all – a blowjob from a dragon was once in a life time…\\nAt least, for the dragon.', 'SCHLURRHP-SHLUURRRRP!\\nCum and mostly-melted, pent-up bones flooded the throat of the black dragon – already well-used to the deluge by now. The dragon had to hide his own excitement – and desperation, as his thick, scaly black tail wiggled..\\nGwloorp… Glooorp… Gwlooorp…\\nThe dragon’s own belly softly grew, as the dragon chugged down seed like an absolute champ. Clearly expanding outward – that maroon-gut becoming sloshingly full of bat-batter. As the torrent of seed subsided,Rholyx\\'s belly bulged obscenely, a testament to Guy\\'s overwhelming virility. Guy, still towering above the sated dragon, grinned with satisfaction.\\n“I’m really just getting started. Come on – you can do better.”\\nAnd indeed – Guy was right. The dragon could do better. After all, Rholyx – the humble author’s personage,if you would - was given that wonderful accolade of coming first as the Most Hungry Dragon of the Y ear.  So – yes, Rholyx could do better, were he manifested into his powerful, quadrupedal self. But – defeated and humiliated by a prior, awfully convenient and convoluted fight-scene, he had been bound into his anthro-self,at the wrong end of a bat’s cock, and contemplating how best to guzzle that shaft with gusto.\\n\"Come on, you sure that\\'s as much as you can manage?\" Guy asked – a bored look in his eyes. The dragon, clearly not a stranger to this bat’s shenanigans, realized the only path for his survival – was to go deeper. Perhaps, even push himself to take the entire shaft, hoping to garner a few extra minutes of survival.\\n(However, really, he was just accelerating his soon-to-be cum-digested demise...)', 'SCHLUURHP-SCHLUURRRHP!\\nWild slurping noises came from the desperate dragon, and desperate in all the right ways. as Guy’s hand gripped the dragon’s scaly forehead, grinning. The desperate schlurp of a dragon who knows if he falls behind– he’d be finding himself in those balls.\\nMmmh – what a good dragon. Shame I don’t intend to leave him alive – he’s almost pitiful.\\n\"Y ou almost done? Kind of wasting daylight, and all.\" Guy relaxed, an arm crossing behind his neck – as he relaxed against the cave wall. His huge, fat balls - gurgling with the digested remains of prior victims, namely several unfortunate townfolk, and of course - the faint and barely visible outline of Rhyolx\\'s mate, Rhaylia who had already been broken down into slosh for him.\\nYes – you did read that write. A few minutes prior to the start of this story, an entire dragoness was vanished and turned into warm, lovely cum-soup for this poor, terrified dragon – a lovely supply of bones rattling around – rejoining their lover right in his gut.\\nGwwlloooorrp… Gwwooooorrrp… Grooooorp…\\nThe dragon’s belly swelled out – more and more, awfully spherical and round from all that lovely seed stretching out his gut, his world-renowned gut struggling to keep up with the torrent of seed sent down his throat – and the dragon was barely able to keep up.\\n\"Awwh, what - does the dragon want a break? Y ou know what that means~\" He grunted - Guy\\'s balls loudly churning and breaking down bone into seed, an audible CRUNCH as it rendered another wave of skeletons into nutjuice.\\n\"Means you get to join your mate right in here~ Y ou\\'d love that, wouldn\\'t you?\"', 'Frankly - Rholyx really would. Not out of sentimentality or anything - but despite that cold, hard exterior of his - he was firmly in the camp of being a lust-addicted dragon. Really, it was a matter of time before he wouldhave ended up in SOMEONE\\'s balls…\\nRight?\\nSCHLRRRRRRRRRRP!\\nEitherway - the dragon\\'s musings were soon ended - his snout vanishing deeper into the cockslit that widened.\\n\"Get in there, already~\" Huffed the lusty bat - who began ignoring the dragon\\'s pained shouts and muffled screams as acidic cum worked into his black scales and face, melting the dragon slowly…\\nGwloooooorp!\\nA fat bulge traveled down the bat\\'s cock, as Guy shifted - glancing over to the ground. A black, ominous booklaying there on the ground - right in front of his huge, furry nuts… A draconic grimoire - that he flicked open, with a bored expression - scanning through it before his eyes widened. Necromantic spells and rituals lined the pages - as a dying Rholyx thrashed around in those balls, and Guy grinned.\\n\"Mmmh, don\\'t worry. Maybe you won\\'t be so useless as bat-spunk~ Or maybe...\" He grinned, groping his balls - helping them break down and turn the black dragon to slosh even faster, as he browsed the pages, his eyes glinting with dark curiosity. The bat\\'s fingers traced the ancient runes, a pulse of dark energy resonating from the grimoire and mingling with the transformative power already at work within him. The words seemed to dance before Guy\\'s eyes, whispering secrets that no living creature was meant to know.\\n\"Oooh, now this,\" Guy chuckled wickedly, \"this could add a little spice to the mix.\"', 'With a flick of his wrist, he opened the grimore – ignoring his shuddering balls melting down the last bits of the dragon to find a page which interested him – a skeletal summoning spell.\\nHe began in a low, guttural tone—the language of necromancy that had many a mortal quaking in fear. The cavern air grew thicker, charged with the energy of forbidden spells that beckoned forth the shadows lurking in its corners. The heavy balls that housed what once was Rholyx twitched with newfound potential…\\nAnd then, there was a loud, fat, GHHRRRRRP that came right from those disturbed balls, full of negative energy. The essence of Rholyx, now but slosh within the confines of Guy\\'s sac, began to respond to the incantation. Guy could feel something growing within him—a formless, writhing power that sought structure and purpose.\\nGuy\\'s indulgent grin broadened as an idea took root in his perverse mind.\\n\"Let\\'s have some fun,\" he murmured into the dimness of the cave. His voice dripped with promise and depravity as he continued to recite from the grimoire…\\nThe churning inside his balls became rhythmical, almost ritualistic in nature. Splatters of acidic cum hit the ground and hissed, turning stone to slosh - as he cummed - letting out a deluge of bones across the ground - and then…\\nA skeletal dragonman arose from the cum - enslaved to Guy’s will, a necromantic puppet pieced together from the remains and slosh that had been Rholyx. The once proud black dragon anthro now stood with empty eye sockets looking towards his new master, his body obeying the whims of the bat that overpowered him.\\nGuy, satisfied with his work, dropped the grimoire to the cave floor with a thud, its pages fluttering slightly as it landed. The skeletal dragonman\\'s claws clicked against the stone as he stepped forward, awaiting instruction- a testament to Guy\\'s overwhelming might and newfound necromantic prowess.', '\"Now then,\" Guy said with a dominating tone, \"Y ou know what they say about power - it\\'s lonely at the top. But I suppose having an undead servant could prove... entertaining.\" He eyed the creature with a mix of amusement and a dark thrill running down his spine.\\nThe reanimated Rholyx didn\\'t respond, not with words. His very essence bound to Guy, he was an echo of will, no room left for defiance or desire—save for what was instilled in him by his new owner.\\nGuy approached the skeletal figure, circling it like a predator assessing its prey. \"Y our first task,\" he began, \"Shall be… Erhm…” He scratched the back of his head, thinking for a second - as he looked around. What exactly did he have in mind?\\nT errorizing the local village? W ell, he’d already done that. The nearest town was at least three days away — toofar for an immediate excursion. No, he needed something more... inventive.\\nAs Guy pondered, a wicked idea sparked in his mind, bringing with it a smirk that spread across his features. \\n“I have JUST the idea for you, big guy~”\\nThe skeleton of Rholyx failed to respond, as Guy ordered him to follow...', 'A caravan of merchants wandered down the road, unaware of the dark presence that lurked within the \\nforest\\'s shadowy embrace. Guy, perched atop a craggy outcrop, surveyed the scene with his undead minion byhis side, as he flipped through the grimore. If he wasn’t mistaken – the caravan carried the colors of the kingdom’s Mage’s Guild – and where there was a mage caravan, there was almost certainly a Crystal of Power.\\nAnd this region - was rich with necrotic energies, thanks to it being the heart of Rholyx’s domain before his untimely demise, most likely dug up from the energetic energy deposits deep beneath the earth, now just ripe for Guy\\'s taking – and exploiting.\\n\"I do believe they have some... Items that might interest me,\" Guy whispered to Rholyx\\'s skeletal form, his voice barely carrying over the gentle rustling of the leaves. The merchants laughed and chatted amongst themselves, oblivious to the danger that approached. “Namely, a crystal. Y ou know the type.”\\nRholyx - failed to respond, only acknowledging his master with an imperceptible nod. Then, with a twitch of his finger, Guy commanded Rholyx to advance. The skeletal dragonman moved forward, rustling through thebrush.\\nThe first unfortunate victim - a catman, standing guard, found himself in a surprising bear-hug by the skeletalRholyx - despite lacking muscle, the strength of dark magic enforced Rholyx\\'s bony grip. The catman\\'s scream was muffled quickly as his body turned pale, life essence draining away - and then, collapsing onto the ground, lifeless.\\nThen - the guard began to stand back up. A lazy, dark-purple tint in his eyes, now a zombie under the bat\\'s command - wandering forward and strangling his comrade who was a few feet away - too busy drinking to realize the situation.\\nGuy watched all of this - from the craggy rock he sat on - reading through his grimore a bit more, as chaos unfolded in the caravan.', '“What else can this baby do..?” He mumbled, as he skimmed through a few more pages…', 'Perhaps an hour later - the majority of the caravan were now undead. W andering aimlessly or standing stoically, with a dead look in their eyes, as the necromancer protege Guy read through a bit more of that grimore - nodding along.\\nIn a brilliant display of necromantic power - Guy promptly held his hand outstretched towards his small armyof undead - and immediately absorbed their souls - in a ghastly, casual ritual that only seemed to add some more impressive girth onto his shaft, all from snuffing out the lives of those unfortunate souls. Their essences funneled into him, swelling his form with unbridled dark vitality – and the caravan, now stood silent, save  forthe sound of Rholyx shifting his weight from one skeletal leg to the other, wandering closer back to his undead master.\\nGuy - held his hand outward towards the undead dragon - hoping for just a bit more of that addictive soul absorption - and yet, nothing came. Annoyed, he snorted, before standing upward, he turned his gaze upon the silent skeleton of the undead dragon. \"Not willing to part with your essence so freely, Rholyx?\" Guy mused aloud, his tone equal parts amusement and challenge. There was a flicker in the skeletal gaze of Rholyx that suggested a spark of rebellion, quickly extinguished under the heavy yoke of Guy\\'s necromantic hold...\\nBut that spark of rebellion was still there, deep down.\\n“W ell, you can always go back into my shaft, if your feeling feisty about it. But we’ll see - did you get the gem…Crystal… Whatever it was…” Guy mumbled, as Rholyx opened his hand, revealing a jagged, luminescent crystal nestled within his bony fingers. The crystal\\'s inner light pulsed as if it had a heartbeat of its own, casting eerie shadows on the surrounding forest. Guy\\'s eyes gleamed, reflecting the strange glow as he reached out and took the crystal from Rholyx\\'s grasp.\\n\"Y ou\\'ve done well… W ell enough to forgive you for your insolence… For now.\" Guy murmured, his voice taking on a reverent hush as he examined the artifact. The power emanating from it was intoxicating, sending shivers of anticipation down his spine. It was more than just a gem; it was a conduit for magic, a source of potential that beckoned to be unleashed.', 'And - combined with his newfound undead powers - well, now he was just downright excited, his balls tingling in excitement, as his gaze shifted to the skeletal-servant.\\n“Y ou can get to work now, you know. No sense in you just standing around.” He smirked, as hesitantly, the dragon resumed his natural position - getting to work sucking off the bat, as Guy sighed.\\nReally - it was a better experience if they were alive and panicking - but this would do, for now.', \"A few days later - Guy’s power continued to manifest itself, as he read more and more of the grimore - the \\ncrystal he found, now securely fastened around his neck with a chain, seemed to resonate with every new incantation he uncovered. Each syllable of forbidden knowledge seemed to feed into the crystal - and each victim that Rholyx found - and thrusted down into those uncaring, deeply-churning heavyset balls, was another soul to power the crystal.\\n“Y ou know, the worst part about these rural counties, is just the lack of people. If this was a city of any kind, I’d be twice my size by now. At least. No, wait - more like ten times.” Guy ruminated, flipping through the grimoire while on the road, his draconic servant keeping up. An ethereal sigh.\\nRholyx - seemed to be growing more and more resistant with each passing day, the faint glimmers of defiance flickering more frequently in his hollow sockets. Y et the grip of necromancy ensured his obedience, even as he scoured the countryside for more souls at Guy's behest.\\nThe landscape rolled by, an endless tapestry of greens and browns broken only by the occasional homestead orlonely hamlet - which was promptly broken into, and the inhabitants eaten, turned into more power - more magic.\\nAfter slurping down an unfortunate foxman farmer into his rear - and guzzling down a peddler or two, Guy couldn’t help but be bored. These people - they always screamed the same, died the same, their souls all just faint twinkles of resistance before being consumed by Guy's bottomless hunger. It was becoming mundane - and he was hardly one to settle for it.\\n“Master…” The dragon mumbled out ethereally, with clear, distinct hesitancy at mentioning the word Master…\\n“…Mh, you can speak now? How annoying.” Guy grumbled. The bony-skeleton of Rholyx - pointed toward the sparkling amulet, filled with power.\\n“Perhaps - if you hunger for something less mundane - use the amulet…” He sinisterly suggested. Guy’s eyebrow raising.\", '“Mmmh. How ominous.” Guy rolled his neck, feeling the satisfying crack of tension releasing from his thickening spine. The crystal\\'s pulse quickened as if it were eager to respond to Rholyx\\'s suggestion. Guy\\'s lips curled into a wry smile, one that promised mischief and mayhem.\\n\"All right, let\\'s see what secrets this pretty crystal has been hoarding,\" Guy said with a chuckle that echoed ominously through the desolate landscape…\\n***\\nRholyx brought the necromancer bat to a long-abandoned graveyard, as Guy held the amulet - soft shades of purple glowing from it, as he held it outward.\\nSuddenly - a soul emerged from the ground, surging towards Guy - absorbed right into his body. The energy from the absorbed soul coursed through Guy, making his muscles bulge momentarily as if teasing a transformation. The graveyard began to stir, an unsettling chorus of whispers swelling through the air. Gravestrembled, and skeletal hands clawed their way out of the earth, untethered spirits answering the necromancer\\'s silent call.\\n\"More...\" Guy muttered under his breath, a glint of insatiable yearning in his eyes. Each apparition that emerged was greedily devoured by his overwhelming presence, and with every soul claimed, the amulet pulsed more vigorously—its light now casting deep violet beams that seemed to slice through the night itself - castingright into graves, as skeletons rose up.\\nAn evil, almost proud look from Rholyx, as he looked onto the bat. Somehow - his skull made the impression of a smirk.\\n“Hmmmh - I think Master, you are more than ready to take care of the mortal city that always plagued me during my life… With my help, of course...”', 'Guy glanced over at him - despite absorbing souls and churning them into cum and growth-fuel, his visage darkened. \"Y es, the city...\" Guy murmured thoughtfully, the words lingering on his lips, before grinning towards the skeleton.\\n“Though, I reckon I ought to take care of a certain dracolich, first and foremost… Loose ends, and all that.” He grinned, as Rholyx’s surprise betrayed his skeletal composure. His hollow eye sockets seemed to blaze witha sudden spark of fear, a fear that was delicious to Guy as he soaked in the moment.\\n“Though, you’ve been useful so far… Anything else you’d care to suggest before your… disposition?” Guy teased, idly fingering the amulet that hung heavily around his neck, its glow now pulsating in sync with his dark amusement.\\nRholyx\\'s skeletal form shifted uncomfortably, bones creaking in a hollow symphony. A sense of self-preservation flickered within him - as he desperately thought up of what he could offer to prolong his existence under the bat\\'s burgeoning power. \"There are rituals,\" Rholyx began, bones rattling with each word,\"Ancient rites that can amplify your powers beyond measure. Rites that not even the grimoire has knowledge of.\"\\nGuy tilted his head, intrigued despite himself. His eyes narrowed skeptically, but the allure of further power was a siren song he couldn\\'t ignore. “Go on…” he prompted, the edge in his voice betraying his impatience forgreater strength...', 'Guy arrived to the city - his skeletal servants all dressed in a variety of dark robes. The two guards, standing \\noutside of the entrance to the city, wielding halberds - gave the crowd of approaching skeletons a wary eye…\\n“I think, Master – they must have noticed me. Or us.”  The voice of Rholyx betraying the classic case of draconic ego. And quite frankly – he might have been right, as a 10’ robed figure was never a harbringer of anything good.\\n“No shit.” Guy rolled his eyes. “I just hope that ritual of yours works…” He grumbled.\\nAs the halberd-wielding guards prepared to challenge the robed procession, a cold wind whipped through the air, carrying with it an aura of dread that set their nerves on edge. Guy strode forward confidently, his amulet now thrumming like a heartbeat against his chest, and the gathered energy within him surged forth, enveloping his entourage in a shroud of darkness. The guards squinted, trying to discern the leader of this strange cavalcade.\\n\"State your business,\" one guard demanded, though his voice trembled with unmistakable fear.\\nGuy simply lifted his hand, palm outward, and from the depths of his sleeve, a swirl of violet mist coiled like a serpent towards the guards. They stood paralyzed as the mist encircled them, their eyes wide with horror as they felt their very souls being siphoned away—transformed into more raw power for Guy to command - standing there, completely under his command, as he grinned.\\n“Now - let’s get this party started. Y ou two - throat. Now.”\\nHe expectantly opened his maw, waiting for the guards to fulfill his command, as they stepped closer - their actions dictated by Guy’s dominating will.', 'The first guard - fully clad in breastplate armor, clamored inside, noisy clanky noises filling the air as he willingly climbed into his doom - the heat of the furnace that was Guy’s stomach already palpable. With a powerful swallow, the guard disappeared past Guy\\'s lips, vanishing into the darkness that was his insatiable hunger. The metal of the armor melted away as if it were no more than wax in a flame - the poor guard not lasting too much longer, making a wonderful bulge for the bat, his belly expanding satisfyingly with the new addition. \\nThe second guard, similarly entranced, followed suit, drawn to his fate like a moth to flame. As Guy\\'s gullet worked to consume the second meal, the sounds of surrendering armor and futile struggles became muffled under his skin…\\nUUUUUUUUUUHAAARP!\\nBones flew out of Guy’s mouth, clattering onto the cobblestones with a grim finality. His belly now stretched and rounded, he patted it affectionately, a deep belch echoing his satisfaction. The energy from the guards coursed through him, his belly rounded – and then, shrunk rapidly, a loud CRUNCH breaking down even bones and armor that weren’t belched up.\\nThe city gates stood ajar now, the usual guardians of order reduced to mere memories within the necromancerbat\\'s growing frame. With a sinister grace, Guy motioned to his skeletal followers, who shuffled forward, their bones rattling in anticipation as they crossed the threshold into the city.\\n\"Spread out,\" Guy commanded, his voice resonating with newfound power. \"Find me the souls ripe for harvesting; leave none untouched.\" The skeletal minions fanned out into the streets, where unsuspecting citizens began to panic at the sight of their macabre visitors…', 'Skeletons and undead ferried poor people and souls to Guy, who stood in the town square, relaxing back as one by one – one SCHLRRRP  followed by another SCHLUUURRP – his gluttonous cock feasted on poortownsfolk. Bulge after lovely bulge – no one was spared. Guards pleaded for mercy, before their rigid kettle-helmets would get pushed inside – skeleton servants quickly and eagerly sending them to those cum-factories that pulsated, gwlorped and groaned.\\n“F-fuck yeah…” Guy grumbled – relaxing back. His colossal balls shuddered – the noise of hundreds of bones cracking, of fur sloughing off – desperate pleading. It just brought him to the edge of orgasm, panting – huffing and puffing… Losing control of the undead – no longer able to pace it...\\nH-how many more… F-fuck, they just won’t stop shoving them down…\\nHis balls shuddered more and more, growing outward, more and more. That fat, juicy shaft of his paling in comparison. He needed to orgasm and bit his tongue, rolling back – as he looked in front of him…\\nThe big, skeletal dragonman, Rholyx, stood over him – bones like treetrunks, a glow in his eyes, as he grinned.\\n“Enjoying, master..?”\\nThe crystal of power – held in an amulet around Guy’s throat shuddered – as Rholyx grinned – snatching it and breaking it off, Guy grunting. How dare he…\\n“W ell, looks like you might be busy for a while… Got a whole town to digest, huh~? Half of them aren’t even down that cock of yours…”\\nRholyx – turned the crystal, holding it.', 'It shone – as the skeleton dragon began to transform, his bones lengthening, thickening, as Guy watched, his eyes widening.\\n\"Now, for that undead army of yours... I believe, that\\'s mine…\"\\nThe skeleton dragon looked - as in an instant – a sea of undead forming in the square, gathering around. Steadily still shoving down helpless townsfolk - as Guy bit his tongue.\\n\"H-how dare you…\"\\nThe dragon took a step forward - a scaly, cold hand squeezing those exercise-sized balls, grinning.\\n\"I should really thank you. Y\\'know, if I melt one of your furs in my gut - there\\'s not even bones left. But thanks to those high capacity balls of yours... I\\'ll have an army... An army to rule the world..!\"\\nAn evil, cackling ethereal laugh came from the dracolich, as Guy bit his lip – that was enough to push him over the edge…\\nHis cock throbbed, a stream of hot, steaming semen rushing forth. The dragon - looking down in shock. Cum orgasmed out - all over the dragon, in such a high-pressure, high intensity load, that it could even melt high-calcium bones to nothingness…\\nUnfortunately for Rhloyx - his legs vanished. Dragonbones melting into slop on the ground. A horrified, ethereal screech, as his body slowly melted away - and he twisted and turned - shrinking down, more and more…\\n\"T-that\\'s it... Haa~\" Guy sighed - his balls deflating from the pressure, finally tappering off - his orgasm not even capable of getting through all the spunk in his tank, as all that was left on the ground - besides a pool of thick, protein-rich batcum... W as the skeletal head of Rholyx.', '\"H-how dare you! I-I\\'ll have you killed for this! KILLED!\" He screeched. Guy picked up the amulet - snapping it back into place, the crystal shining, as Rhloyx fell silent - and still.\\nHe looked around - at all the undead. All under his command.\\nHe looked down at the mess on the ground…\\nAnd, without thinking twice, bent over, grabbing Rholyx\\'s head…\\nPushing it against his haft.\\n\"Get to work, already...\" Guy grunted. \"As you said - I got a town to melt down into spunk, and your just slowing me down...\"\\nThe poor skeletal dragon had a defeated look on his skull as the cum-drenched rod was shoved into his skull. It didn\\'t take long before he felt the heat and pressure from that throbbing shaft of Guy\\'s, and the first rope of thick, chunky cum erupted into his skull, making his eyes light up and his jaws clamp down onto that heftygirth. His skull expanded to accommodate that bulging member as it spurted and twitched within his bony confines, the dragon slowly falling into his rhythmic pattern - even as his skull melted…\\nIt wouldn\\'t be too much longer, before the very memory of Rholyx - and his soul, would be destroyed utterly,Guy grunting as he looked at the flow of townsfolk, rudely interrupted being slurped down.\\n“Fuck, I could have gotten even more, but you had to make me climax… Asshole…” He grunted. “Good thingyour gonna melt. But there’s no way I’m gonna not absolutely absorb that soul of yours… So better slow down, if you like existing.”\\nUnfortunately - Rholyx was enough of a slut to not listen, once he got to work. Despite it being in his best interest to slow down - he couldn\\'t help but speed up. Faster - and faster. More and more acidic cum eating away at his bones - until...', 'W ell - there was nothing. Just slop on the ground - from what used to be Rholyx - his soul being sucked out, and completely obliterated into nothingness. A little, itty-bitty soul, now floating towards that cock, his soul joining the long-line of others who thought themselves important, and now - reduced to being nothingness.\\n“Finally – fuck. Guess he wasn’t bad, as a slut…” Guy grumbled, before looking at the crowd. “Now – what the hell are all you waiting for? Keep it coming. I got some size to make up for now…”\\n***\\nSCHLUUHRRRRP\\nThe captain of the guard - a beefy bovine minotaur, was forced against that bulge - easily twice the size of Guy, but his bovine snout was being firmly clamped down on by Guy\\'s cockflesh, slurped up quickly.\\n\"F-fuck, a big guy like you - is gonna make for an even BIGGER load... Now, hurry up, will ya..?\"\\nA loud belch sent bones across the cobblestones - a few townsfolk he had decided to swallow up finally melting away. It was paltry, compared to those balls - his fat shaft working the minotaur slowly, enjoying and taking it\\'s time…\\nSo - maybe he needed some more stimulation. Guy\\'s hand slipped down to his ass - widening it out.\\n\"Any takers, for wanting to pad out my ass? C\\'mon, it\\'s either this, or you get in line to get cum-digested, and trust me - that\\'s painful...\" He said, towards the crowd of rapidly-thinning victims - though lying through his sharp, mischievous teeth. Really - getting slurped up by his ass was probably painless in comparison - but oncethey hit the gut…\\nW ell, they\\'d wish they took him up on his offer and waited around to be bat-protein. And surely enough - a cute, fox damsel, in a cute dress, walked forward.', '\"I-I guess... I\\'ll take the easy way out...\" She mumbled, defeated. Hiding perhaps - a faint blush at her newfound necromantic overlord - but before she could do anything else silly or cheesy - Guy grunted, perhapsannoyed - and stuffed that snout right up her ass.\\n\"Sorry sister - don\\'t swing that way. Better luck... Next... Time...\" He grunted - simultaneously getting more progress on taking that minotaur down his shaft (though, the minotaur was already getting relatively mushy and soft), and clenching to slurp that annoying fox-lady up…\\nSCHLUURHRP-SCHLUURHPR-SCHLAARP!\\nT o the horror of the diminished crowd - they witnessed the minotaur melt - traveling down the bulge, and still contributing significantly to those bat-balls. Each schlurp - each groan…\\nIt was only a matter of time.\\n***\\nAn hour later – the entire marketplace was splattered in cum. Guy’s army – had nearly tripled in size, and his balls finally empty, his gut full, but no-longer sloshing. That big, fat bat-cock still hanging out, hungrily.\\n“Mmmh, fuck – better send you guys out to get me a few more snacks, huh? Is this what it’s like, being the bad guy..? With minions, and stuff?” Guy sat back – in a makeshift throne. A big, burly minotaur skeleton busy worshipping his shaft.\\n“Hope you were gay before, because there’s a whole lifetime – and more, of worshipping your better~” Guy grunted, smirking at the minotaur, any free-will firmly clamped out – unlike that troublesome Rholyx. ', \"“Hope you were gay before, because there’s a whole lifetime – and more, of worshipping your better~” Guy grunted, smirking at the minotaur, any free-will firmly clamped out – unlike that troublesome Rholyx.\\nThough, in retrospect – that slut might have made a good, loyal servant too, with enough cocksucking.\\nStill – Guy couldn't complain. He was now the overlord of this place – and soon, perhaps even the entire realm, when his army grew big enough…\\nWith a deep breath, he exhaled, relaxed – and sat back to enjoy the spoils of victory...\"]\n"
